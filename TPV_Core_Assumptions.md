**Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework**  
**Status:** Canonical / Non-negotiable unless explicitly revised  
**Last Updated:** v1.4

## Purpose

This document defines the **irreducible physical assumptions** of the Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework.  
All derivations, papers, discussions, and AI interactions must treat these assumptions as **authoritative** unless a revision is explicitly proposed and accepted.

---

## Core Assumptions

### 1. Physical Ontology (Primary Postulate)

The vacuum is a **continuous, non-particulate, hyper-elastic medium**.  
Spacetime geometry is **not fundamental**; it is an emergent kinematic description used by observers embedded within the medium.

---

### 2. Dimensionality

Physical reality consists of **three spatial dimensions only**.  
**Time is not a dimension.**

---

### 3. Nature of Time

Time is a **derived bookkeeping concept** that measures the **local rate of physical change**, defined operationally by cyclic or irreversible processes.

There is no independent temporal axis through which objects or information can move.

---

### 4. Arrow of Time (Absolute Constraint)

**Backward time travel is impossible — full stop.**

This is a physical impossibility, not a technological limitation, arising from:

- Irreversible redistribution of energy  
- Monotonic relaxation of accessible phase configurations  
- Absence of a temporal degree of freedom to traverse  

Closed timelike curves and retrocausal dynamics are excluded by construction.

---

### 5. Causality

Causality is enforced by the **directionality of energy propagation and relaxation** in the medium.

Effects cannot precede causes because **change itself is directional**, not because of spacetime geometry.

---

### 6. Continuity of the Medium

The medium is **fully continuous**.  
There are no gaps, jumps, discrete elements, or pointlike constituents.

All physical processes occur through **material continuity**.

---

### 7. Topological Deformation and Adjacency

Local structures may **deform the medium through folding, twisting, or overlay**, creating **topological adjacency** between regions that are distant in ordinary spatial embedding.

Energy propagation always proceeds **locally through the material**, but may travel **from fold to fold** along these adjacencies rather than along an undeformed, zigzag spatial path.

No material is skipped.  
Effective path length is reduced by **topology**, not by nonlocality.

---

### 8. Wave and Phase Support

The medium supports:

- Transverse (shear) waves  
- Longitudinal (compressive / tensional) modes  
- **Multiple phase states**, not limited to three, each with distinct propagation characteristics  

Wave behavior is governed by continuum mechanics and phase accessibility.

---

### 9. Speed of Light (c)

The speed of light represents the **maximum rate of energy propagation achievable in the lowest-resistance, vacuum-accessible phase regime** **without forming a stable structure**.

Formally:
\[
c = \sqrt{\mu / \rho}
\]
where μ is shear modulus and ρ is density.

Physically, this corresponds to the **fastest sustainable propagation of an unstable phase-transition pulse**, not a fundamental spacetime limit.

---

### 10. Inverse Phase Ordering

TPV phases are **inversely ordered relative to conventional matter**:

- Maximum compression → slowest propagation  
- Decompression → faster propagation  
- Phase transition → discontinuous (orders-of-magnitude) increase in propagation rate  

Propagation speed is governed by **phase accessibility**, not proximity alone.

---

### 11. Matter Constitution

Matter consists of **self-stabilized standing-wave or folded configurations** of the medium.

These structures **trap and redirect energy locally**, reducing effective propagation speed relative to free-phase modes.

Matter is not fundamental; it is a **metastable configuration** of the continuum.

---

### 12. Spinors (Foundational Concept)

Spinors are **physical descriptors** of orientation and phase topology of folded configurations in the medium.

They arise from **topological rotation constraints** (e.g., 4π symmetry), not from abstract Hilbert-space postulates.

---

### 13. Spin and Statistics

Particle spin and statistical behavior emerge from:

- Topological closure conditions  
- Chirality and twist  
- Continuity and deformation constraints  

They are not assumed as axioms.

---

### 14. Relativistic Effects

Length contraction and time dilation arise as **dynamic stability conditions** required to preserve phase coherence of translating wave-based matter.

They are emergent consequences of matter–medium coupling.

---

### 15. Lorentz Invariance

Lorentz invariance is **emergent**, not fundamental.

In the linear elastic regime, it is exact for all observable processes, rendering the medium undetectable by internal observers.

---

### 16. Gravity Mechanism

Gravity arises from **stress-induced gradients** in density and elastic moduli of the medium.

It is not fundamentally geometric, though its observable effects are kinematically equivalent to spacetime curvature in the weak-field regime.

---

### 17. Gravitational Lensing

Light deflection occurs via **anisotropic refraction** in stressed phases of the medium, produced jointly by:

- Density gradients  
- Shear-modulus softening (photo-elastic response)

---

### 18. Photons (Unstable Phase-Transition Pulses)

A photon is **not a stable particle** and **not a standing wave**.

It is a **propagating instability** corresponding to an **attempted phase transition** that fails to localize:

- Sufficient energy to access a higher-propagation phase  
- Insufficient energy to remain folded or trapped  
- Forced to propagate because local equilibration is impossible  

---

### 19. Directionality of Light Propagation

Light propagates forward because:

- Phase relaxation proceeds only toward accessible configurations  
- Reverse propagation would require undoing local relaxations  
- This is forbidden by continuity and energy constraints  

Light is intrinsically directional even though time is not a dimension.

---

### 20. Superluminal Internal Modes (Constrained)

Certain **internal longitudinal or tensional relaxations** may propagate faster than c **along topological adjacencies**.

These modes:
- Do not transmit controllable signals  
- Do not violate causality  
- Do not permit backward influence  

---

## Scope Note

These assumptions define the **ontology and kinematics** of TPV.  
Specific phase counts, constitutive relations, and strong-field behaviors remain open research questions and are addressed elsewhere.
