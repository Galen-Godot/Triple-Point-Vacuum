**Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework**  
**Status:** Canonical Definitions  
**Last Updated:** v1.4

## Purpose

This document defines the **canonical terminology** of the Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework.

All documents, discussions, and AI interactions must use these terms **as defined here**.  
Synonyms or redefinitions are not permitted unless explicitly stated.

---

## Core Concepts

### Vacuum
The **relaxed solid phase** of the hyper-elastic continuum.  
It is not empty space and not spacetime; it is the baseline material state supporting wave propagation.

---

### Hyper-Elastic Continuum
A **continuous, non-particulate medium** capable of nonlinear elastic response under deformation, compression, and folding.  
All physical phenomena in TPV arise from its dynamics.

---

### Phase
A regime of the continuum characterized by:
- Compressibility
- Energy-propagation resistance
- Connectivity and topology

Phases are **not limited to three** and may form a hierarchy or continuum.

---

### Triple Point
A conceptual reference to a regime where **multiple phases coexist** and transitions are readily accessible.  
The term does not imply that only three phases exist.

---

### Compression
A local increase in energy density and folding of the medium that generally **reduces propagation speed** by increasing effective path length.

---

### Decompression
A reduction in local energy density or folding that generally **increases propagation speed** by reducing effective path length.

---

### Topological Deformation
A rearrangement of the medium involving folding, twisting, or overlay that alters **connectivity** without breaking continuity.

---

### Topological Adjacency
A condition in which regions of the medium are **locally neighboring due to deformation**, despite being distant in ordinary spatial embedding.

Energy propagation proceeds locally across such adjacencies without skipping material.

---

### Propagation Path
The actual contiguous material route followed by energy redistribution, which may differ from naive geometric distance due to folding or topology.

---

### Energy Propagation
The process by which energy redistributes through the continuum via local interactions.  
Propagation always respects continuity and causality.

---

### Speed of Light (c)
The **maximum sustainable propagation speed** of an unstable phase-transition pulse in the vacuum-accessible regime.

Formally:
\[
c = \sqrt{\mu / \rho}
\]

where μ is shear modulus and ρ is density.

c is a **material and phase-dependent limit**, not a spacetime conversion constant.

---

### Shear Wave
A transverse deformation of the medium that propagates at or below c in the vacuum phase.

---

### Longitudinal / Tensional Mode
A compressive or tensional deformation of the medium.  
Such modes may propagate faster than shear waves **along topological adjacencies**, without enabling signaling.

---

## Matter and Excitations

### Matter
A **self-stabilized, metastable configuration** of the continuum formed by standing waves, folds, or topological constraints.

Matter is not fundamental; it is a persistent pattern of deformation.

---

### Standing-Wave Structure
A bounded interference configuration that traps energy locally and defines a stable physical object.

---

### Topological Fold
A localized, folded configuration of the medium whose stability derives from geometry, topology, and phase constraints.

---

### Spinor
A physical descriptor of **orientation and phase under rotation** of a folded configuration.

Spinors arise from topological rotation constraints (e.g., 4π symmetry), not from abstract quantum postulates.

---

### Spin
A manifestation of real geometric twist and chirality of a folded configuration.

---

### Statistics
Collective behavior (fermionic or bosonic) emerging from topological closure, overlap constraints, and continuity.

---

### Photon
An **unstable phase-transition pulse**:
- Sufficient energy to access a higher-propagation phase
- Insufficient energy to remain localized or folded
- Forced to propagate because local equilibration is impossible

A photon is not a stable particle and not a standing wave.

---

### Light
The observable propagation of photon pulses at speed c through the vacuum-accessible phase of the medium.

---

## Relativity and Gravity

### Time
A derived scalar measure of the **rate of physical change or energy redistribution**.  
Time is not a dimension.

---

### Arrow of Time
The intrinsic directionality of irreversible relaxation processes in the medium.

---

### Relativistic Effects
Length contraction and time dilation arising as **dynamic stability conditions** for translating wave-based matter.

---

### Lorentz Invariance
An emergent symmetry of observable processes in the linear elastic regime, enforced by matter–medium coupling.

---

### Gravity
A phenomenon arising from **stress-induced gradients** in density and elastic moduli of the medium.

---

### Gravitational Lensing
Deflection of light due to **anisotropic refraction** in stressed regions of the medium.

---

## Extreme Regimes

### Black Hole
A **maximally compressed, highly folded phase regime** of the continuum in which effective propagation paths become extremely long and propagation correspondingly slow.

No assumption is made about interior phase structure beyond this description.

---

### Superluminal Internal Modes
Internal relaxation or constraint-enforcement processes that may propagate faster than c **without transmitting controllable information** or violating causality.

---

## Usage Note

Terms defined in this document are **binding** across the TPV Framework.

If a term is not defined here, it should not be treated as fundamental.
