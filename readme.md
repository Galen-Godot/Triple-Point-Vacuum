# Epistemic Structure of the Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Repository

## Purpose of This Document

This document explains **how to read this repository correctly**.

TPV is an exploratory physical framework developed as a *toy-model ontology*.  
The repository intentionally separates **assumptions**, **derivations**, and **speculative exploration** into distinct layers.

Failure to observe this separation will lead to misinterpretation.

---

## What TPV Is (and Is Not)

**TPV is:**
- A mechanically motivated ontology for vacuum, matter, and spacetime
- A framework that treats relativity, quantum behavior, and gravity as emergent phenomena
- A research sandbox with multiple active lines of inquiry

**TPV is not:**
- A validated theory of nature
- A claim of experimental confirmation
- A replacement for established physical theories
- A claim that speculative consequences are real

## Repository Structure and Epistemic Layers

The repository is organized into three epistemic layers.  
Each layer serves a different role and carries different standards.

### 1. Core Assumptions (SSOT)

**Location:**  
`core_assumptions.tex` (and related SSOT documents)

**Status:**  
Foundational / Conservative / Locked

**Purpose:**  
Defines the *minimal ontological commitments* of the TPV framework.

**Rules for this layer:**
- Contains no experimental claims
- Contains no speculative mechanisms
- Contains no predictions
- Contains no claims about propagation speeds or causal violations

This layer answers:
> *What must be assumed for TPV to even be internally coherent?*

Nothing in this layer should be read as controversial beyond its ontology.

---

### 2. Mechanisms and Derivations

**Location:**  
`papers/`, `mechanisms/`

**Status:**  
Technical / Scoped / Conditional

**Purpose:**  
Explores specific mechanisms that follow from the core assumptions under stated conditions.

**Rules for this layer:**
- All claims are conditional on explicit assumptions
- Regimes of validity are stated
- Results are not elevated to ontology
- Agreement with existing theories is preserved where applicable

This layer answers:
> *If TPV behaves like this in a given regime, what follows?*

---

### 3. Exploratory Sandboxes

**Location:**  
`sandbox/`, `exploratory/`

**Status:**  
Speculative / Discardable / Non-binding

**Purpose:**  
Explore extreme, edge-case, or unconventional consequences of TPV assumptions.

This includes:
- Superluminal phenomenology
- Possible causality breakdowns
- Vacuum rest-frame detection ideas
- Non-standard signaling scenarios

**Rules for this layer:**
- Nothing here is assumed to be true
- Nothing here is claimed to be necessary
- Everything here is allowed to be wrong

This layer answers:
> *If TPV were pushed beyond conservative regimes, what might happen?*

---

## On Speculative Topics (Important)

Certain topics (e.g., superluminal behavior, nonlocal constraint enforcement, or signaling) may appear in this repository.

Their presence **does not imply endorsement**.

They are included because:
- TPV is explicitly a toy model
- Exploring discardable possibilities is part of the research process
- Eliminating possibilities requires first articulating them

Readers should treat such material as *sandbox exploration*, not claims about reality.

---

## Traceability Rule

Any claim in this repository must be traceable to:
- A core assumption, or
- A stated mechanism, or
- An explicitly marked speculative exploration

Claims that do not satisfy this are errors.

---

## How to Read This Repository

If you are new:
1. Start with `core_assumptions.tex`
2. Then read one mechanism paper (e.g., Lorentz invariance)
3. Only then explore sandbox material

Skipping this order will almost certainly lead to misunderstanding.

---

## Final Note

TPV prioritizes:
- Mechanical necessity over intuition
- Stability over postulate
- Explicit uncertainty over false coherence

This repository is structured to reflect those priorities.
