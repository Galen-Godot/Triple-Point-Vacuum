**Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework**  
**Status:** Canonical Derivations / Layer A  
**Last Updated:** v1.4

---

## Purpose

This document records the **core derivations and results** of the Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework.

All entries here satisfy at least one of the following:

- Derived directly from continuum mechanics and wave stability
- Shown to be observationally degenerate with established physics
- Constrained by existing experimental data

Speculative extensions, ontological hypotheses, and untested mechanisms are intentionally excluded and belong in `TPV_Open_Questions.md`.

## 1. Dynamic Origin of Lorentz Invariance

### Result

Lorentz invariance arises as a **dynamic stability condition** for translating standing-wave structures embedded in a linear elastic continuum.

It is **not postulated** as a fundamental symmetry.

---

### Outline of Derivation

- Matter is modeled as a **bounded standing-wave structure** formed by counter-propagating modes in the continuum.
- When such a structure translates relative to the medium, phase coherence requires asymmetric internal wavevectors.
- Enforcing:
  - Rigid translation of the interference envelope
  - Invariance of internal oscillation frequency in the comoving frame
- Leads uniquely to:
  - Length contraction:  
    \[
    L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}
    \]
  - Rate reduction (“time dilation”):  
    \[
    \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0
    \]

where \( \gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2} \).

---

### Interpretation

Relativistic kinematics emerge from **phase-coherence constraints**, not spacetime geometry.

Any matter constructed from wave interference processes must obey Lorentz transformations to remain stable.

---

## 2. Michelson–Morley Null Result

### Result

A translating interferometer composed of wave-based matter exhibits **no observable phase shift** due to uniform motion through the medium.

---

### Outline of Derivation

- Interferometer arms contract dynamically by \( 1/\gamma \) when aligned with motion.
- Internal clocks slow by the same factor due to reduced internal cycle rate.
- Longitudinal and transverse round-trip travel times equalize exactly.

\[
\Delta T = T_\parallel - T_\perp = 0
\]

---

### Interpretation

The null result does **not** rule out a physical medium.

It instead rules out the assumption that measuring devices are rigid and independent of their motion relative to the medium.

---

## 3. Speed of Light as a Phase-Accessibility Limit

### Result

The observed speed of light corresponds to the **maximum sustainable propagation rate of an unstable phase-transition pulse** in the vacuum-accessible regime.

---

### Derivation Basis

From linear elasticity:
\[
c = \sqrt{\mu / \rho}
\]

where:
- \( \mu \) is shear modulus
- \( \rho \) is density

---

### Interpretation

- \( c \) is **not** a spacetime conversion factor.
- It is a **material limit** on how rapidly energy can propagate without collapsing into a stable folded structure.
- This interpretation is fully consistent with all precision measurements of \( c \).

---

## 4. Photons as Unstable Phase-Transition Pulses

### Result

Photons are **propagating instabilities**, not stable particles or standing waves.

---

### Properties

- Carry sufficient energy to access a higher-propagation phase
- Insufficient energy to remain localized or folded
- Must propagate forward because local equilibration is impossible

---

### Consistency with Data

- Photons are inherently non-localizable in QFT
- Photon number is frame-dependent
- No photon rest mass has been observed
- No contradiction with dispersion or polarization constraints, provided phase accessibility is symmetric

---

## 5. Gravitational Lensing as Anisotropic Refraction

### Result

The full Schwarzschild light-deflection angle arises from **anisotropic refraction** in a stressed hyper-elastic medium.

\[
\delta = \frac{4GM}{c^2 R}
\]

---

### Derivation Components

- Density increase under gravitational compression
- Shear-modulus softening via photo-elastic (Poisson) response
- Combined effect doubles the deflection predicted by scalar-density-only models

---

### Interpretation

Gravitational lensing is **observationally degenerate** with spacetime curvature in the weak-field regime.

This result matches all current lensing observations.

---

## 6. Observational Degeneracy with General Relativity

### Result

In the weak-field, linear regime, TPV reproduces the empirical predictions of General Relativity for:

- Light deflection
- Time delay
- Kinematic Lorentz invariance
- Interferometric null results

---

### Scope Limitation

This equivalence holds only where:
- Strains are small
- Phase transitions are not triggered
- Constitutive relations remain linear

Strong-field and nonlinear regimes are not yet derived.

---

## 7. Spinors from Topological Rotation Constraints

### Result

Spin-½ behavior emerges naturally from **topological folding and rotation constraints** of localized structures in the continuum.

---

### Basis

- Certain folded configurations require a \( 4\pi \) rotation to return to an identical physical state.
- This behavior matches experimentally observed spinor properties (e.g., neutron interferometry).

---

### Interpretation

Spinors describe **real geometric and topological features** of matter, not abstract quantum degrees of freedom.

---

## 8. Causality Preservation

### Result

TPV preserves causality without invoking spacetime structure.

---

### Mechanism

- Energy propagation is directional due to irreversible relaxation.
- Topological adjacency can shorten effective paths but does not permit backward influence.
- Superluminal internal relaxations cannot transmit controllable information.

This is consistent with all Bell-test and signaling-constraint experiments.
