# Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework

**Author:** Galen Godot  
**Status:** Active research framework  
**License:** TBD

## Description (≤350 chars)

The Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework models the vacuum as a phase-structured, hyper-elastic continuum. Relativistic kinematics, particle properties, and light propagation emerge from folding, topology, and energy-propagation limits, without treating spacetime or time as fundamental.
