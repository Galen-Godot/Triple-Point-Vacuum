**Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework**  
**Status:** Explicitly Speculative / Research Horizons  
**Last Updated:** v1.4

## Purpose

This document collects **open problems, unresolved mechanisms, and speculative extensions** of the Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) Framework.

Nothing in this file is assumed to be established fact.  
All entries represent **questions, hypotheses, or research directions** that must be resolved, constrained, or falsified before being promoted to `TPV_Core_Derivations.md`.

This separation is intentional and essential.

## 1. Phase Taxonomy Beyond the Triple Point

The “triple point” terminology is a **conceptual anchor**, not a claim that only three phases exist.

### Open Questions
- How many distinct phases does the vacuum medium support?
- Are there continuous phase families or only discrete regimes?
- Do phase boundaries depend on:
  - Compression
  - Energy density
  - Topological strain
  - History (hysteresis)?

### Motivation
Current evidence suggests **more than three phases**, particularly in extreme regimes (e.g., black holes, early universe).

---

## 2. Black Holes as Extreme Phases

Black holes are treated as **maximally compressed, highly folded phases** of the medium.

### Open Questions
- Is the black-hole interior a single terminal phase, or a hierarchy of deeper phases?
- Does propagation speed asymptotically approach zero, or plateau at a finite minimum?
- Are horizons sharp phase boundaries or extended transition regions?
- How does Hawking radiation arise in phase-language?

### Constraints
Any model must remain consistent with:
- Exterior GR predictions
- Lensing and shadow observations
- Gravitational-wave ringdown data

---

## 3. Quantitative Relation Between Compression and Propagation Speed

While TPV assumes:
> greater compression → slower propagation

the **functional form** is unknown.

### Open Questions
- Is propagation speed monotonic with compression?
- Are there critical thresholds or discontinuities?
- How do topology and folding density modify effective path length?

---

## 4. Topological Adjacency Networks

Local folding can create **topological adjacencies** that shorten effective propagation paths.

### Open Questions
- Are such adjacencies:
  - Ephemeral and dynamic?
  - Long-lived structural features?
- Do they form networks or isolated connections?
- Can they store information or only transmit constraints?

### Relevance
This directly impacts interpretations of:
- Quantum entanglement
- Nonlocal correlations
- Superluminal internal relaxations

---

## 5. Entanglement Mechanisms

TPV permits **nonlocal correlations without signaling** via topological or phase-based connectivity.

### Open Questions
- What physical structures mediate entanglement?
- Are entangled systems connected by:
  - Persistent filaments?
  - Temporary phase bridges?
  - Constraint-based adjacency only?
- What sets entanglement lifetime and decoherence?

### Constraint
No mechanism may allow controllable superluminal signaling.

---

## 6. Spin–Statistics Connection

Spinor behavior is derived topologically, but the **full spin–statistics theorem** is not yet reproduced.

### Open Questions
- How does fermionic antisymmetry arise mechanically?
- Can bosonic enhancement be derived from fold overlap?
- Is statistics a global topological property or local constraint?

---

## 7. Photon Quantization

Photons are treated as **unstable phase-transition pulses**, but energy quantization is not yet derived.

### Open Questions
- Why do photon energies appear discretized?
- Is quantization emergent from boundary conditions or resonance?
- Can Planck’s constant be derived from medium properties?

---

## 8. Energy-Dependent Propagation and Dispersion

TPV must reproduce extremely tight observational constraints on vacuum dispersion.

### Open Questions
- Are phase-accessibility limits strictly energy independent?
- Do higher-energy photons access different micro-phases?
- If so, why are deviations observationally suppressed?

---

## 9. Gravitational Waves in TPV

Gravitational waves are treated as propagating stress disturbances.

### Open Questions
- Are they shear, longitudinal, or mixed modes?
- Why do they propagate at ≈c in observed regimes?
- How do they behave near phase boundaries?

---

## 10. Cosmology and Expansion

Cosmic expansion is hypothesized to arise from **phase evolution** of the medium.

### Open Questions
- Is expansion driven by phase relaxation, evaporation, or decompression?
- Can TPV reproduce:
  - The CMB spectrum?
  - Large-scale structure?
  - Observed acceleration without dark energy?

---

## 11. Emergence of Quantum Mechanics

TPV provides an ontology, but not yet a full reconstruction of quantum formalism.

### Open Questions
- How does the Schrödinger equation emerge?
- What is the precise meaning of the wavefunction?
- Is probability epistemic, emergent, or physical?

---

## 12. Experimental Discriminants

TPV must ultimately make **testable distinctions**.

### Open Questions
- Are there regimes where TPV deviates from GR or QFT predictions?
- Are there condensed-matter analogs that can be experimentally probed?
- Can phase transitions be triggered or detected indirectly?

---

## Scope Note

Items in this document are **intentionally unresolved**.

Their presence does not weaken TPV; it **protects the framework** by clearly marking the boundary between established results and future work.
