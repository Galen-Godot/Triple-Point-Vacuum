BOOT_DOMAIN — Triple Point Vacuum (TPV)
1. Status and Intent

The Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) is a toy ontology of physics, not an established theory.

Its purpose is exploratory and generative, not confirmatory.
TPV is being developed to test whether a small number of structural assumptions about “vacuum” can reproduce, reinterpret, or coherently reframe:

wave–particle duality

quantization

mass–energy relations

relativistic effects

nonlocal quantum correlations

TPV should be treated as discardable at every layer.

2. Core Ontological Commitment (Minimal)

TPV assumes the following, and nothing more unless explicitly derived:

The vacuum is not empty
It is a continuous physical substrate with state.

The substrate supports deformation
Deformations propagate as waves.

Stable excitations exist
Localized, persistent deformation patterns correspond to what are called “particles.”

No assumptions are made about:

standard quantum fields

spacetime as fundamental

Lorentz invariance as ontologically primary

Those may emerge, fail, or require reinterpretation.

3. Triple Point Concept (Informal)

“Triple point” refers to a regime where the substrate simultaneously exhibits:

elastic / solid-like behavior

fluid-like flow

radiative / wave-like propagation

These regimes are not separate phases but coexisting modes of the same substrate, with dominance determined by scale, energy density, and boundary conditions.

4. Waves and Excitations

TPV distinguishes (provisionally) between:

longitudinal compressive modes

transverse shear modes

compound / hybrid modes

Observed particles may correspond to:

standing wave knots

topologically stabilized defects

resonance-locked excitation bundles

This classification is tentative and subject to revision.

5. Time, Causality, and Reference Frames

TPV does not assume time is fundamental.

Instead:

time is treated as an accounting parameter for change

causality is assumed to be globally consistent in a preferred substrate frame

relativistic causal paradoxes are interpreted as projection artifacts of moving frames

Superluminal phenomenology is not ruled out a priori, but no claims of signaling are asserted.

6. Quantum Phenomena (Provisional Interpretation)

In TPV:

superposition may correspond to unresolved substrate configurations

entanglement may reflect shared substrate modes or boundary conditions

measurement corresponds to energy exchange that forces mode resolution

These are interpretive placeholders, not claims of explanation.

7. Constraints and Discipline

TPV must obey the following discipline:

No appeal to “it just works”

No hidden extra dimensions without necessity

All added structure must reduce, not increase, assumptions

Contradictions must be logged, not patched

8. Open Questions (Non-exhaustive)

What stabilizes particle-like excitations?

How does mass arise in substrate terms?

Can relativistic invariance emerge statistically?

What observable signatures would distinguish TPV from standard models?

9. Relationship to Synthesis

TPV is being used as a stress test for Synthesis.

The goal is not to prove TPV correct, but to see whether:

conceptual drift can be controlled

assumptions can be tracked

uncertainty can be preserved rather than erased

10. Explicit Non-Claims

TPV does not currently claim:

experimental validation

predictive power

compatibility with all known physics

ontological truth

It claims only internal coherence as a toy framework under construction.
