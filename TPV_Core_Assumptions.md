\section*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Document type:} Foundational assumptions / single source of truth
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} Explicitly state the minimal ontological commitments of the TPV framework
    \item \textbf{Rule:} Any derived result, mechanism, or speculation must be traceable to these assumptions
\end{itemize}

\section{Ontology of the Vacuum}

The vacuum is not empty space and not abstract geometry.

It is a truly continuous physical substrate, ontologically prior to matter, fields, and spacetime descriptions.

The vacuum is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item non-particulate,
    \item non-granular,
    \item continuous at all physically meaningful scales.
\end{itemize}

It supports deformation, phase behavior, and wave propagation.

Matter, radiation, and spacetime behavior are emergent phenomena of this substrate.

\section{Phase Structure of the Vacuum}

The vacuum exists near a triple-point--like equilibrium between distinct phases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vacuum phase:} relaxed, solid-like continuum
    \item \textbf{Dark phase:} intermediate, amorphous, pressure-bearing phase
    \item \textbf{Baryonic phase:} highly strained, topologically stable excitations
\end{itemize}

Phase transitions are real physical processes governed by local stress, density, and energy balance.

Particles correspond to metastable phase excitations rather than fundamental entities.

\section{Energy Is Never Static}

Energy in the TPV framework is never static.

All energy exists as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item resonant modes,
    \item propagating modes,
    \item or dynamically maintained steady states.
\end{itemize}

Static fields do not exist as frozen entities. What appear as static configurations are time-periodic or steady-state resonances.

The only exceptions are pathological limits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item complete compression (singularity-like regimes),
    \item complete expansion (loss of all gradients and structure).
\end{itemize}

Outside these limits, energy is always dynamically evolving.

\section{Matter as Topological Resonance}

Matter is not particulate.

A particle is a stable, topologically protected resonance or fold of the vacuum continuum.

Each particle consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a highly strained core,
    \item a smooth interface layer,
    \item embedding within the relaxed vacuum phase.
\end{itemize}

Particles are geometrically smooth, dynamically stable, and internally coherent, consistent with ultra-precision measurements of particle observables.

\section{Spin and Chirality}

Spin is not an abstract quantum label.

Spin corresponds to a chiral internal mode (circulation or torsion) of a vacuum excitation.

A spin ``superposition'' corresponds to a metastable, time-dependent internal mode that has not yet locked into a stable chiral orientation.

Spin measurement or interaction corresponds to symmetry breaking and stabilization into one of two allowed chiral attractors.

Spin is quantized due to topological stability and is not associated with geometric asymmetry of the particle.

\section{Interface Layer and Vacuum Coupling}

Each particle possesses an interface layer between its strained core and the ambient vacuum.

This interface layer is characterized by lower effective density than the ambient vacuum, but not low enough to induce a phase transition.

The interface layer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item stabilizes the particle,
    \item mediates energy exchange with the vacuum,
    \item defines how the vacuum responds to the particle’s presence.
\end{itemize}

\section{Origin of Electric Charge}

Electric charge arises from a dynamically maintained vacuum density gradient associated with the particle’s interface layer.

The density gradient determines the magnitude of electric force.

Charge is not a static substance or intrinsic property; it is an ongoing vacuum--particle energy configuration.

Positive and negative charge correspond to opposite directions of vacuum relaxation relative to the interface layer.

\section{Direction of Force and Role of Spin}

The direction of electric force is determined by the orientation (phase or handedness) of the particle’s spinor, not by geometric asymmetry of the particle.

Thus:
\begin{itemize}
    \item force magnitude is scalar (density gradient),
    \item force direction is axial (spinor orientation),
    \item the particle itself remains smooth and symmetric.
\end{itemize}

This separation prevents electric dipole moments and preserves consistency with precision experimental bounds.

\section{Magnetism}

Magnetism is not a separate interaction.

It arises from coherent alignment of chiral vacuum excitations, producing persistent torsional stress patterns in the vacuum.

A permanent magnet is a material that locks many spinor orientations coherently, imprinting a sustained torsional bias into the vacuum.

Magnetic fields correspond to circulatory shear patterns, not compression.

\section{Electromagnetic Waves}

Electromagnetic radiation consists of propagating transverse shear disturbances of the vacuum continuum.

Polarization corresponds to the orientation of shear oscillation.

Emission occurs when a particle’s dynamic resonance is disturbed, breaking steady-state balance.

\section{Gravity}

Gravity is not a force carrier and not geometry alone.

It is an entropic, macroscopic vacuum effect arising from constrained vacuum energy, phase imbalance, and large-scale density gradients.

Refractive effects of light arise from stress-induced changes in vacuum properties.

\section{Lorentz Invariance}

Lorentz invariance is not fundamental.

It emerges dynamically because matter is composed of vacuum-supported resonances that must self-adjust under translation to remain stable.

A physically real vacuum rest frame exists but is dynamically hidden from equilibrium observers.

\section{Research Boundaries}

The TPV framework does not claim full validity in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item singularity regimes,
    \item complete vacuum dissolution,
    \item total phase collapse.
\end{itemize}

These represent acknowledged boundaries of applicability rather than failures of the framework.

\section*{Closing Statement}

The Triple Point Vacuum framework prioritizes mechanical necessity over intuition, coherence over convenience, and dynamic processes over static abstractions.

Any future extensions must respect these core assumptions or explicitly revise them.
