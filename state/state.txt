Triple Point Vacuum (TPV) is a toy ontology of physics designed to explore foundational concepts related to the vacuum. It assumes the vacuum is a continuous physical substrate with state, supporting deformations that propagate as waves. The substrate exhibits solid, fluid, and wave-like behaviors concurrently, known as the "triple point." 

It distinguishes between longitudinal, transverse, and hybrid wave modes, suggesting particles may correspond to stable deformations in this substrate. Time is treated as a parameter for accounting change, and causality is maintained in a preferred substrate frame. Quantum phenomena are interpreted through unresolved configurations, shared modes, and measurement as an energy exchange.

Core questions remain about particle stabilization, the emergence of mass, and observable signatures that might differentiate TPV from standard physics models. The framework's validity is not claimed, emphasizing internal coherence as it evolves.

Assumptions include:
- The vacuum is a continuous substrate with states, not empty.
- Deformations are waves, and stable excitations correspond to "particles."
- Time is not fundamental, and causality is substrate-based.
- Superluminal phenomena aren’t ruled out, though no signaling claims are made.

Unresolved questions include:
- The nature of particle stabilization.
- How mass arises from the substrate. 
- Statistical emergence of relativistic invariance.
- Observable distinctions between TPV and established models. 

Current state is exploratory, maintaining flexibility and room for reinterpretation. It serves as a testbed for tracking assumptions, preserving uncertainty, and addressing potential conceptual drift.
